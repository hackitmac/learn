>We want to empower programmers to make educational sessions!

We needed to teach an Intro to HTML & CSS workshop. But there wasn't an easy, quick way to create an online programming workshop.

What our jekyll template aims to do is that it lets you create workshops in markdown with extra styling features for errors and tips. It provides a way to give beautiful, consistent text based programming workshops.
