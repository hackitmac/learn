##Let's get set up
You should download the following:

+ Sublime Text([link](http://www.sublimetext.com/)) - a text editor with colour highlighting and other helpful features.
+ Google Chrome ([link](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)) - Choose a modern web browser that supports current web standards and has good development tools. It's best to set a modern browser as your default browser.

##Opening HTML files in your browser

###First, what is a browser?
The browser's main functionality is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window.
The web resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be a PDF, image, or other type.

###What is an HTML document?
Let's check out an example. Right-click and select View Page Source on this page. That's HTML.

We'll be learning to write our own HTML today. But first, let's open an HTML document (like the ones we'll create later) in our browser.

1. Open Sublime Text and go to File > Open.
2. Navigate to the Project folder (in the folder you downloaded with today's slides).
With the entire folder selected, click Open.
3. Now that the folder is open in Sublime, click on blank.html so that it fills the screen. Now, right click and select Open in Browser.

  Don't be scared about breaking anything or doing something wrong. Play around, take risks, experiment and make mistakes. That's the best way to learn.

  <strong>And remember, ask a mentor (or Google) for help!</strong>

##What are HTML & CSS?
HTML & CSS are languages used to format how a website will look.

###HTML
**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. But all you need to know is that it is a markup language. It tells the web browser what elements aka "content" to display. HTML uses a pre-defined set of [elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). HTML does not do the styling of the content.

Example HTML
{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

###CSS

##Pratice
Trying going through the interactive tutorials on https://dash.generalassemb.ly/.

##Looking up documentation or help
If you are looking up something about HTML/CSS use [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) instead of [http://www.w3schools.com/](http://www.w3schools.com/). W3schools can be outdated and has a lower quality of documentation. Reasons [http://www.w3fools.com/](http://www.w3fools.com/)

This can be done simply by adding `mdn` at the end of your searches.  
Ex. Search `div mdn` instead of `div`. First link will always be Mozilla Developer Network.
